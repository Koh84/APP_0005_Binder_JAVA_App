IHelloService.aidl is equivalent to IHelloService.h in cpp binder
we then use android to compile it into IHelloService.java, this is equivalent to BnHelloService.cpp which inherits from .interface but we need to override the sayhello and sayhello_to from stub and also we can use 
the proxy as it defines the BpHelloService.cpp

(1) AIDL
1. 把 IHelloService.aidl 放入 frameworks/base/core/java/android/os
2. 修改 frameworks/base/Android.mk  添加一行
         core/java/android/os/IVibratorService.aidl \
+        core/java/android/os/IHelloService.aidl \

3. mmm frameworks/base

4. 它会生成: ./out/target/common/obj/JAVA_LIBRARIES/framework_intermediates/src/core/java/android/os/IHelloService.java


HelloService.java is equivalent to BnHelloService.cpp, it should inherit from .stub and BpHelloService.cpp
